## About Dataset
This dataset is sourced from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. Its purpose is to enable the prediction of whether a patient has diabetes based on diagnostic measurements.

## Context
The dataset contains diagnostic measurements related to diabetes in females who are at least 21 years old and of Pima Indian heritage. It comprises various features such as pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin levels, body mass index (BMI), diabetes pedigree function, age, and the outcome variable indicating the presence or absence of diabetes.

## Dataset Details
The dataset includes the following features:

- **Pregnancies:** Number of times pregnant
- **Glucose:** Plasma glucose concentration two hours after an oral glucose tolerance test
- **BloodPressure:** Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- **SkinThickness:** Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
- **Insulin:** 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- **BMI:** Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction:** Diabetes pedigree function
- **Age:** Age in years
- **Outcome:** Class variable (0 for absence, 1 for presence of diabetes)

## Usage
This dataset is commonly used for machine learning and data analysis tasks. It serves as a valuable resource for building predictive models to identify the likelihood of diabetes based on individual patient characteristics.
